Video/chat based skill learning app where people take turns to post challenges and complete tasks.

## Why?

1. Provides platform for easy skill and know-how sharing among people with same interests. The knowledge is exchanged quickly and skills are learned more efficiently than by single person's effort.
2. Drives friendly competition, keeps users motivated and hastens the progress of learning.
3. A tool for easy content and process management.
4. Has versatile and unlimited applicability from peer circles to schools to companies. Is easily scalab.e

## How?

A user can create a group of two or more people interested in learning the same skill, or browse and join existing groups. One group memeber posts a video with him/her performing a certain task – a challenge. Others learn the task and upload their own videos performing it. Once the challenge is beaten by each member of the group, it is the next member's turn to come up with a new challenge.

A single person can:
- either create his/her own group/chat room or
- join already existing group/chat room as either active “participant” or as an “observer”

In the group/ chat room an active “participant” can:
- accept the challenge/ task
- post new challenge/ task
- skip turn
- comment

In the group/ chat room an "observer" can:
- watch videos
- comment(?)
- change status to "participant"

## Example

A "theme" concept has proven to be a successful tool to prevent repetitiveness and loss of interest. User 1 comes up with a new theme, eg. triceps in fitness; left hand dribbling in basketball, major chords in music, etc. The theme is displayed on the group’s page. The user films and posts his/her challenge/task within a certain theme that he/she came up with. Everyone beats the challenge, posting their video responses. Then user 2 comes up with his version of the challenge within given theme and everyone responds. Then user 3, and so on.

Once everyone in the group gets a chance to make up an exercise within the given theme, user 2 is given an option to change the theme. The circle repeats. Then user 3 is given an option to change theme, and so on.
